## I would describe myself as a hybrid professional working at the intersection of _***Mechanical Engineering***_ and _***Manufacturing***_.  
</br>

I am really passionate about building innovative products right from ideation to series production. I have a breadth of abilities across the Mechanical Engineering spectrum and in-depth knowledge in Production. My objective is to build products that can connect to the end user rather than applying problem solving engineering principles.
